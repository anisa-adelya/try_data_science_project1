This project learns how to perform fake news detection using Python and machine learning. 
The machine learning model created utilizes the sklearn library. This is done by constructing a TfidfVectorizer on the provided dataset. 
Prior to this, the dataset already contains labels indicating whether the news is fake or real. 
Following this, the classifier is initialized for the news items using the PassiveAggressive algorithm and the model is fine-tuned. 
Once the model is successfully built, to ascertain its accuracy, we display the accuracy score and confusion matrix of the model.
